## Background
This was a project to start getting used to using javascript on my pages. Initially, it started out with the user being prompted for how many games they wanted to play. Then, the human was prompted again whether they wanted to play rock, paper, or scissors and any necessary error handling would be used. Then a random selection was made for the computer, and the game would let you know via another popup whether or not you won the game. After 5 games, a winner is declared. This was outlined in <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors"> Project: Rock Paper Scissors </a>

The next iteration of the project was to create a new branch and add a very lite amount of front end for the user to interact with. Now, the user would select a button to play rock paper or scissors, then the text on the page would update to tell who the winner was and what the series count is. After the computer or human won 5 games, they were declared the winner. This was outlined in <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors"> Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors </a>

Future work would make the UI look a whole lot cleaner. Currently it is very basic and ugly, but it was good for the point of learning more javascript and how to interact with the DOM.
