## Background

This is part of the Odin curriculum where we were getting into some Intermediate HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a sign-up form for an imaginary service. Nothing crazy was done for the css so it could probably be a bit cleaner, but this was mostly to flex some of the concepts learned, namely position, advanced selectors, forms, & custom properties
