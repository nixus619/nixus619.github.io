My interest in drones started when my older brother got me a drone from Amazon for Christmas one year. On it's maiden flight, I promptly flew it directly into a tree. Since then I've gotten a little better at flying (thanks to how easy they make it to fly newer drones), but my photo taking and editing could definitely use some work. Here are some of my better shots.
